"""
wsz6_play/engine/game_runner.py

Async-safe game runner that wraps a SOLUZION6 formulation instance.

Owns the state stack, applies operators, handles undo, and broadcasts
state / event messages to all consumers in the Channel group via the
caller-supplied ``broadcast_func``.

Usage (inside a Django Channels consumer):

    from channels.layers import get_channel_layer

    channel_layer = get_channel_layer()
    group_name = f"game_{session_key}"

    async def broadcast(payload: dict):
        await channel_layer.group_send(group_name, payload)

    runner = GameRunner(formulation, role_manager, broadcast)
    await runner.start()
    await runner.apply_operator(op_index)
    await runner.undo()

SZ5-bug prevention note:
    Each play-through gets its **own** formulation instance, loaded fresh
    from the PFF by pff_loader.load_formulation().  Never share a
    formulation between sessions.
