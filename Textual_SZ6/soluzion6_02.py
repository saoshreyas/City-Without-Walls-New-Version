'''soluzion6_02.py
Operational version of soluzion6_01.py, which only provided stubs for
the class definitions.
Although each class here is intended to be subclassed in any useful
new problem formulation, all classes here can be instantiated
directly and the default game will be a "counting game" with initial
state 0, one operator called "Next", and one role called "counting-game player".

Updated Nov 25, 2025.  S. Tanimoto.
Ready to be tested with a new bare-bones textual game engine.

# To do: Implement special precondition function called "try_xition_func"
# that attempts to apply the state transition function, within a Try-Except
# block, returning False if an exception occurs, and True otherwise.
# When True, the new state is saved in the "cached_new_state" array (indexed
# by operator numbers) in a game engine, in the array location associated
# with the current operator.  Then, if and when the operator is actually applied,
# the cached new state is retrieved and used as the new state.
# The apply method will first check for the presence of a cached new state,
# and if found, will use it directly, otherwise it will call the state transition function.
# This approach allows operators that may fail to be tried without raising exceptions
# that would interfere with the game engine's operation.
# Note that try_xition_func would not be appropriate with parameterized operators.
