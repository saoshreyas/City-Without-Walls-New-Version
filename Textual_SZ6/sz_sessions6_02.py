ABSTRACTIONS FOR GAME ENGINES

Abstractions needed by game engines, but not needed in
problem formulations.
Status: Stubs here should be fleshed out enough to be
minimimally operational.  They can be subclassed
by the game engines.

The SZ_Solving_Session (typically representing a game play_through)
can be instantiated to get a default game
play_through in which 
a role assignment object is pre-populated with a default player
taking the role of counting-game player, but the rest of
the game play-through is empty. A game engine would normally do the 
instantiation of the game session.
